## **HUMANITARIAN OVERVIEW**

![](/sites/default/files/inline-images/fu-2-chart-1_1.png)

* In the early morning hours of 8 October, Israeli authorities evacuated thousands of inhabitants of 25 towns surrounding the Gaza Strip. The evacuation coincided with renewed exchange of fire and infiltrations by members of armed Palestinian groups into Israeli towns. During the night of the 8 October, Israeli forces issued evacuation orders to Palestinian communities in Gaza, potentially affecting hundreds of thousands of people who have been told to relocate into the centre of Gaza city amid ongoing Israeli forces air and land strikes and the firing of rockets by Palestinian armed groups.
* Palestinian armed groups in Gaza have fired thousands of rockets and mortar shells into Israel since the current round of hostilities began on 7 October. The Barzilai hospital in the Israeli town of Ashkelon was hit with rocket fire from Palestinian armed groups, causing damage to the hospital. Furthermore, members of Palestinian armed groups shot and killed one paramedic and injured four others. Several buildings and livelihood structures in Sderot, among other locations, were damaged.
* Israeli airstrikes and shelling have targeted houses and apartment buildings in Gaza. In some cases, residential buildings were reportedly struck without warning for residents to evacuate. Notably, four large residential towers with multiple floors of residential units (Palestine, Al-Hashim, Wattan, and Al Aklouk) in Gaza city were completely destroyed. Israeli forces reportedly provided prior warnings in these cases and there were no fatalities reported from these incidents. According to the Gaza Ministry of Public Works and Housing, 159 housing units have been destroyed, while 1,210 have suffered severe damage.
* Six health care workers were killed and four injured by Israeli airstrikes that also damaged seven health care facilities and nine ambulances. Damage to WASH related facilities from Israeli airstrikes has undermined the provision of water, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH) services to over 400,000 people.
* The hostilities have led to internal displacement. More than 17,500 families, comprising over 123,538 people, have been internally displaced in Gaza, mostly due to fear, protection concerns and the destruction of their homes. Out of the internally displaced persons (IDPs), UNRWA estimates 73,538 people are sheltering in 64 schools, some of which are designated emergency shelters. The UNRWA designated emergency shelters in the Gaza Strip were activated to host the displaced and provide them with urgent assistance.
* ![](/sites/default/files/inline-images/fu-2-chart-2.png)Erez and Kerem Shalom crossings remain closed due to the escalation. Among those unable to exit were 130 referred patients and their accompaniers with scheduled appointments at medical facilities in the West Bank, including East Jerusalem, or in Israel. The Rafah crossing with Egypt were open today and allowed 100 truckloads of food items, 30 truckloads of fuel, and 70 truckloads of construction materials to cross.
* In the evening of 7 October, Israeli authorities ceased supplying electricity to the Gaza strip, reducing the hours of electricity to 3-4 per day. The Gaza Power Plant is currently the only source of power and could run out of fuel within days.
* In the West Bank, including East Jerusalem, confrontations with Israeli forces have persisted for the second consecutive day in multiple locations. Between 7 and 8 October, as of 21:00, 13 Palestinians, including a 12-year-old child, were killed by Israeli forces in various areas across the West Bank. One of the Palestinians was killed while attacking or allegedly attempting to stab a member of the Israeli forces near Al Lubban al Gharbiyeh (Ramallah). Another individual was shot and killed during an armed clash between Palestinians and Israeli forces near the Deir Sharaf checkpoint (Nablus). The remaining eleven Palestinians were all killed during demonstrations in solidarity with the Gaza Strip and other confrontations involving stone throwing.
* PRCS reported that since 7 October and as of 8 October at 12:00pm, they treated 191 Palestinian injuries in the West Bank including East Jerusalem, of which 38 from live ammunition, 26 from rubber bullets, 101 were treated for teargas inhalation, eight from shrapnel, and 18 were physically assaulted.
* Israeli settlers injured three additional Palestinians; one by live ammunition, another by a rubber bullet, and a third was stabbed. On 7 October, settlers reportedly from Itamar attacked Palestinian farmers in Yanun (Nablus), injuring one farmer and damaging five vehicles. On that day, settlers reportedly from Esh Kodesh closed the road connecting Qusra and Jalud (Nablus), firing live ammunition and injuring a Palestinian man while also setting fire to three agricultural rooms. Additionally, on the same day, a Palestinian man was stabbed and injured in Yasuf (Salfit) during a settler attack involving an attempt to set fire to three Palestinian houses.
* The Israeli authorities have continued to impose multiple movement restrictions, including the closure of several checkpoints and entrances to towns and cities in the West Bank. This includes the Shuâ€™fat Refugee Camp and Beit Iksa town both in Jerusalem, which remain under closure for the second consecutive day, restricting the movement of more than 27,000 Palestinians from accessing essential services, including healthcare. Additionally, Israeli forces closed all checkpoints segregating part of the Israeli-controlled area of Hebron (H2) from the remainder of the city, impeding the movement of 7,000 Palestinian residents of the area, including from accessing essential services.
* A general strike was announced in the West Bank, resulting in the closure of all markets, shops, and education facilities.
* Humanitarian needs across the OPT continue to rise, the response to which is impeded by a current lack of access.

* With the high number of casualties, there is urgent need for trauma and emergency care following the trauma pathway and the caseload continues to increase.
* The insecurity is hindering access to essential health care services for the population as healthcare workers and patients are unable to reach healthcare facilities.
* Movement restrictions across the West Bank and potential risk of settler attacks at junctions has disrupted mobile clinics, UNRWA and some MoH health facilities.

**Response to Date**

* Fifteen out of 22 UNRWA health centres across the Gaza strip have resumed providing primary healthcare services from 09:00 â€“ 12:00 to patients with urgent referred appointments. Treatment is provided for non-communicable diseases and critical outpatient cases. Provision of health care services through the toll-free hotline continues.

**Key Constraints and Gaps**

* Insecurity and movement restrictions are hindering access to essential health care services as both healthcare workers and patients cannot move.
* Attacks on ambulance services and health facilities hinder service delivery.

## **Food Security**

**Priority Needs**

* UNRWA food operation remains on hold, disrupting the third distribution cycle for 112,759 families.
* Access to agriculture: Strawberry and tomato farmers are at risk of losing their entire seasonal production due to access restrictions.
* Inaccessibility to olive trees could lead to losing olives and oil.
* Closure of Kerem Shalom crossing means that no fodder enters Gaza. This endangers the livestock and poultry sectors affecting the livelihoods of over 10,000 producers and the provision of animal protein to Gaza.
* Electricity and fuel cuts will affect refrigeration, irrigation, incubation, and other machinery that will affect agriculture, poultry, cattle, fish, and other products.
* Closure of the sea puts at risk more than 4,000 fisheries.

**Response to Date**

* FSS partners are preparing ready-to-eat food rations of fresh bread and canned tuna for 44,000 IDPs seeking shelter in UNRWA schools over the next two weeks and are planning to provide CBT vouchers to 50,000 IDPs outside of UNRWA shelters with a transfer value of 10.3$ (USD) per person if funding and shop accessibility allows.
* Market monitoring of food availability and prices has begun.

**Key Constraints and Gaps**

* The closure of Kerem Shalom, Erez and Allenby Commercial terminal poses challenges for the entry of food items into Gaza.
* Farmers cannot access their lands for daily agricultural practices (crop service, irrigation, harvesting).
* Lack of electricity and fuel.

## **Education**

**Priority Needs**

* All education facilities in the West Bank and Gaza are closed, affecting more than 1,400,000 children.

**Key Constraints and Gaps**

* Insecurity and movement restriction is resulting in school closure and limited access of service providers to schools.
* Electricity cuts make online distance learning almost impossible.

## **WASH**

**Priority Needs**

* All solid waste collection and transfer to landfills remains on hold.
* Two WASH facilities in the Gaza strip were affected. These facilities served over 400,000 people with water and sanitation services.
* Gaza's current electricity generation is less than 60 MW. This falls significantly short of the necessary power to sustain WASH services across the entire Gaza Strip.
* There is an urgent need for an alternative power supply source. In the meantime, providing fuel (Emergency fuel of 20,000 liters/day) is of paramount importance to support WASH facilities in their continued operation.
* The chlorine supply for the water treatment plants, currently using the emergency supply, must be replenished.
* Spare parts for the water and sanitation facilities and infrastructure to be used as part of the emergency repair need to be replenished.
