### Gaza Strip Updates

* Intense Israeli bombardment and ground operations as well as heavy fighting between Israeli forces and Palestinian armed groups continue to be reported across much of the Gaza Strip, particularly in Az Zaitoun area of Gaza city and in northwest Khan Younis, resulting in further civilian casualties, displacement, and destruction of houses and other civilian infrastructure. Palestinian armed groups continued to fire rockets into Israel.
* Between the afternoon of 1 March and 10:30 on 4 March, according to the MoH in Gaza, 306 Palestinians were killed, and 543 Palestinians were injured, including 124 killed and 210 injured in the past 24 hours. Between 7 October 2023 and 10:30 on 4 March 2024, at least 30,534 Palestinians were killed in Gaza and 71,920 Palestinians were injured, according to MoH in Gaza.
* Between the afternoons of 1 and 4 March, according to the Israeli military, four Israeli soldiers were killed in Gaza. As of 4 March, 244 soldiers have been killed and 1,453 soldiers injured in Gaza since the beginning of the ground operation, according to the Israeli military. In addition, over 1,200 Israelis and foreign nationals have been killed in Israel, the vast majority on 7 October. As of 4 March, the Israeli authorities estimate that 134 Israelis and foreign nationals remain captive in Gaza, including fatalities whose bodies are withheld.
* The nutrition crisis in northern Gaza is rapidly deteriorating. As of 3 March, MoH in Gaza reported that 15 children had died of malnutrition and dehydration at Kamal Adwan Hospital in northern Gaza, and expressed fear for the lives of six other infants who are suffering from acute malnutrition. On 3 March, the UNICEF Regional Director for the Middle East and North Africa, Adele Khodr, [stated](https://www.unicef.org/mena/press-releases/statement-adele-khodr-unicef-regional-director-middle-east-and-north-africa-1) that the “tragic and horrific” child deaths in Gaza are unfolding despite being “man-made, predictable and entirely preventable.” According to Ms. Khodr, “the lives of thousands more babies and children depend on urgent action being taken now” to prevent famine, and “for this we need multiple reliable entry points that would allow us to bring aid in from all possible crossings, including to northern Gaza; and security assurances and unimpeded passage to distribute aid, at scale, across Gaza, with no denials, delays and access impediments.”
* Israeli airstrikes on Rafah continue to be reported. On 2 March, MoH in Gaza reported that 11 people were killed, and some 50 others were injured, when tents housing IDPs and people gathered in front of Al Emirati field hospital in Tall as Sultan area of Rafah were hit. Among the fatalities was a nurse and a member of the field hospital’s ambulance crew. According to Médecins Sans Frontières ([MSF](https://x.com/MSF/status/1764027512357519527?s=20)), this MSF-supported field hospital is the primary maternal health facility in southern Gaza, and in recent weeks patients “have voiced their fear of entering the hospital due to systematic attacks in and around healthcare facilities across Gaza.” On 2 March, the Israeli army [stated](https://twitter.com/AvichayAdraee/status/1764000152459608144) that it had carried out a “precision strike” in the area of the hospital, targeting militants from the Islamic Jihad group. The Director-General of the World Health Organization, Tedros Ghebreyesus, [described](https://x.com/DrTedros/status/1763995475999420430?s=20) the incident as “outrageous and unspeakable,” and reiterated that health workers and civilians must be protected at all times. Last week, the UN Secretary-General [warned](https://www.un.org/sg/en/content/sg/statement/2024-02-26/secretary-generals-remarks-the-human-rights-council-bilingual-delivered-scroll-down-for-all-english) that an Israeli offensive on Rafah, which is already hosting over half of Gaza's population of 2.3 million people, would jeopardize the core of the humanitarian aid operation.
* The following are among the deadliest incidents reported between 1 and 3 March:  
   * On 1 March, at about 3:50, ten Palestinians were reportedly killed when a house sheltering IDPs in Al Bureij Camp, in Deir al Balah, was struck.  
   * On 1 March, in the afternoon, ten Palestinians were reportedly killed, and many others injured, by airstrikes in Az Zaytoun neighbourhood in Gaza city.  
   * On 1 March, at about 23:50, 16 Palestinians were reportedly killed when several houses in Deir al Balah were struck.  
   * On 2 March, 20 Palestinians were reportedly killed, and 16 others injured, when a house in western Jabalya Camp, in North Gaza, was struck.  
   * On 2 March, at about 23:00, 14 Palestinians were reportedly killed when a four-story house in As Salam neighbourhood, in southeast Rafah, was struck.  
   * On 2 March, at about 23:00, ten Palestinians were reportedly killed when a house near Abu Hussain School in Jabalya Refugee Camp was struck.  
   * On 3 March, at about 10:50, at least eight Palestinians were reportedly killed, and others injured, when a civilian vehicle in Deir al Balah was struck.
* According to MoH in Gaza, the death toll from the 29 February incident on Rashid Road south of Gaza city, where people were killed and injured while seeking lifesaving aid, has risen to 118, and tens of the 760 injured people remain in critical condition due to the lack of capacity to save their lives. In a press statement on 3 March, the UN Security Council members [expressed](https://press.un.org/en/2024/sc15608.doc.htm) deep concern about the incident as well as the estimation that the entire population of Gaza is facing alarming levels of acute food insecurity, urging Israel “to keep border crossings open for humanitarian aid to enter Gaza, to facilitate the opening of additional crossings to meet humanitarian needs at scale, and to support the rapid and safe delivery of relief items to people in all of the Gaza Strip.” On 1 March, the UN Human Rights Office ([OHCHR](https://reliefweb.int/report/occupied-palestinian-territory/un-human-rights-office-opt-un-human-rights-office-strongly-deplores-killing-least-112-palestinians-during-food-aid-distribution-gaza-city-enar?utm%5Fsource=rw-subscriptions&utm%5Fmedium=email&utm%5Fcampaign=country%5Fupdates%5F180)) strongly deplored the incident, noting that since mid-January “the Office has recorded at least 14 incidents involving shooting and shelling of people gathered to receive desperately needed supplies at … two entrances to Gaza city - with a majority of these incidents resulting in casualties.” On 2 March, one Palestinian was reportedly killed and more than 20 injured by gunfire while people were gathering in anticipation of a humanitarian aid delivery on Rashid Road in Gaza city. Tens of casualties were also reported on 3 March, as people gathered to receive aid supplies at the Kuwaiti roundabout in Gaza city, according to MoH in Gaza.
* On 1 March, the Director-General of the World Health Organization (WHO) [stated](https://twitter.com/DrTedros/status/1763680245826179563) that, after more than a month, a UN mission had managed to reach Shifa Hospital in Gaza city and deliver 19,000 litres of fuel, life-saving medicine for 150 people, and treatment for 50 children suffering from severe acute malnutrition. The Head of the OCHA Gaza Sub-Office [stated](https://twitter.com/UNOCHA/status/1763692296636133644) that the hospital was treating more than 200 people injured during the 29 February incident on Rashid Road at the time of their visit. “We have seen people with gunshot wounds, we have seen amputees, and we have seen children as young as 12 that were injured ... These events cannot be allowed to go on. We need to have safe, secure passage throughout Gaza to reach the people that need humanitarian aid. We need every single crossing into Gaza opening and these people need to have not just food and water. We hope that in the coming days, large convoys with food will come into North Gaza, and in this way we can then reach people, talk to them, and see what other needs they have.”
