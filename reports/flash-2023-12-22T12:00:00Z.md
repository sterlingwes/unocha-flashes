22 Dec 2023 

\* The next Flash Update will be issued on Tuesday 26 December, covering 23-26 December.

## Key points

* Following a shutdown of telecommunications and internet services in Gaza on 20 December, a partial restoration of services was achieved in the southern and central parts of the Gaza Strip on 21 December at about 20:40.
* On 22 December, heavy Israeli bombardments from air, land, and sea, continued across most of the Gaza Strip. Except for Rafah, intense ground operations and fighting between Israeli forces and Palestinian armed groups continue, in most areas. The firing of rockets by Palestinian armed groups into Israel also continued. Between 18 and 20 December, 390 Palestinians were reportedly killed, and another 734 people were injured, according to the Ministry of Health (MoH) in Gaza.
* According to the MoH in Gaza, between 7 October and 7:00 on 22 December, at least 20,057 Palestinians were killed in Gaza. About 70 per cent of those killed are said to be women and children. As of then, 53,320 Palestinians have been injured. Many people are missing, presumably buried under the rubble, waiting for rescue or recovery. On 22 December, the [UN Secretary-General stated](https://www.ochaopt.org/content/remarks-media-secretary-general): “There is no effective protection of civilians in the Gaza Strip” as “intense Israeli bombardment and ground operations continue.”
* Between 21 and 22 December, two Israeli soldiers were reportedly killed in Gaza. Since the start of the ground operation, 140 soldiers have been killed in Gaza, and 784 soldiers have been injured, according to the Israeli military.
* On 22 December, the Israeli military designated a new area covering about 15 per cent (approximately 9 square kilometres) of the Middle Area governorate for evacuation. The area was marked in an online map published on social media. Prior to the onset of hostilities, this area was home to nearly 90,000 people. The area also includes six shelters that accommodated about 61,000 internally displaced persons (IDPs), the vast majority of whom were previously displaced from the north.
* The affected areas include Al Bureij and An Nuseirat Refugee Camps and north of An Nuseirat (Az Zaharaa, and Al Moughraga). Instructions accompanying the map call residents to move immediately to shelters in Deir al Balah, which is already overcrowded, hosting several hundred thousand of IDPs. The scope of displacement resulting from this evacuation order remains unclear.
* The Chief Economist of the World Food Programme (WFP) noted that the scale and speed of the unfolding acute food insecurity situation in Gaza, observed over just two months, are unprecedented in their severity. The entire population in the Gaza Strip faces an imminent risk of famine, according to the [latest estimates](https://www.ipcinfo.org/ipc-country-analysis/details-map/en/c/1156749/?iso3=PSE) from the Integrated Food Security Phase Classification (IPC) global partnership on 21 December. The proportion of households affected by acute food insecurity is the largest ever recorded globally, according to IPC report.
* The Famine Review Committee (FRC), activated due to evidence surpassing the acute food insecurity Phase 5 (Catastrophic threshold) in the Gaza Strip, warns that the risk of famine increases daily amid intense conflict and restricted humanitarian access. The committee added that to eliminate the famine risk, it's imperative to halt the deterioration of health, nutrition, food security, and mortality through the restoration of health and WASH services. The cessation of hostilities and the restoration of humanitarian space for delivering multisectoral assistance are vital first steps to eliminate any risk of famine.
* On 22 December, the UN Security Council passed Resolution 2722 on expanding the immediate, safe and unhindered delivery of humanitarian assistance at scale into Gaza. [The UN Secretary-General emphasized](https://www.ochaopt.org/content/remarks-media-secretary-general) that evaluating the effectiveness of the humanitarian aid operation in Gaza should not solely rely on the number of trucks entering the enclave. “The real problem is that the way Israel is conducting its offensive is creating massive obstacles to the distribution of humanitarian aid inside Gaza,” he said. “An effective aid operation in Gaza requires security; staff who can work in safety; logistical capacity; and the resumption of commercial activity. These four elements do not exist,” the Secretary-General concluded, urging Israel to take measures that would remove barriers in the way of aid distribution.
* On 22 December, 69 trucks carrying supplies and five ambulances entered Gaza through Rafah crossing and 23 trucks entered through Kerem Shalom crossing. This remains well below the daily average of 500 truckloads (including fuel and private sector goods) that entered every working day prior to 7 October.

### Hostilities and casualties (Gaza Strip)

* The following are among the deadliest incidents reported on 22 December:  
   * On 21 December at about 21:57, a residential building in Old Gaza Street, in Jabalya City, where tens of IDPs were sheltering was truck. On the following day, 22 December, 16 Palestinian bodies were reportedly pulled out from the rubble and more than 50 Palestinian injuries were reported.  
   * On 21 December, at 15:00, seven Palestinians were reportedly killed when a house was struck in west of An Nuseirat Refugee Camp.  
   * On 21 December, at about 21:55, eight Palestinians were reportedly killed when a house was struck in the customs control area, in the Ma’an area, east of Khan Yunis.  
   * On 22 December, at about 10:50, four Palestinians were reportedly killed when a residential building was struck in Jabalya city.
* On 22 December, a UNDP staff member was killed along with his wife, three sons, and two daughters as an airstrike hit the area where they were sheltering in Gaza city. The airstrike also reportedly claimed the lives of more than 70 members of his extended family. A total of 136 UNRWA staff, one WHO staff and one UNDP staff have been killed since 7 October.
* According to the Palestinian Journalist Syndicate in Gaza, 82 Palestinian journalists and media workers have been killed in Israeli airstrikes since 7 October. According to the Gaza Ministry of Health, 310 Palestinian medics have been killed. According to the Palestinian Civil Defense at least 20 civil defense members have been killed.

### Displacement (Gaza Strip)

* Areas encompassing about 30 per cent of the Gaza Strip (excluding the orders to evacuate the areas north of Wadi Gaza) have been marked for evacuation on the Israeli military’s online map. Access to this information is impaired by recurrent interruptions in telecommunications and the lack of electricity.
* Following multiple orders by Israeli forces for Palestinians to evacuate, many IDPs are now in southern Gaza. The two largest sites in the Rafah governorate, where thousands have relocated to and erected makeshift structures and tents, are in an under-construction hospital (‘the Qatari field hospital’) and the campus of the Al Quds Open University.
* Tens of thousands of IDPs, who have arrived in Rafah since 3 December, continue to face extremely overcrowded conditions both inside and outside shelters. Large crowds wait for hours around aid distribution centres, in desperate need of food, water, shelter, health, and protection. Without enough latrines, open-air defecation is prevalent, increasing concerns of further spread of disease, particularly during rains and related flooding.
* Obtaining an accurate figure of the total number of IDPs remains challenging. According to UNRWA, 1.9 million people in Gaza, or nearly 85 per cent of the population, are estimated to be internally displaced, including people who have been displaced multiple times.
* Lack of food, basic survival items, and poor hygiene, further exacerbate the already dire living conditions, amplify protection and mental health issues, and increase the spread of disease.

### Electricity

* Since 11 October, the Gaza Strip has been under an electricity blackout, after the Israeli authorities cut off the electricity supply, and fuel reserves for Gaza’s sole power plant were depleted. For more information on electricity supply to the Gaza Strip, please see this [dashboard](https://www.ochaopt.org/page/gaza-strip-electricity-supply).
* Health care, including attacks (Gaza Strip)
* On 22 December, the Palestine Red Crescent Society (PRCS) announced that some of its staff members and paramedics who had been arrested on 21 December, were released late in the evening after being subjected to beatings, while eight staff members remained in custody. Additionally, PRCS reported that during the military operation, Israeli forces destroyed the wireless communication system in the centre along with ambulances in the branch.
* On 21 and 22 December, the vicinities of Al Amal and European hospitals, both located in Khan Younis in the south of Gaza and operational medical facilities were struck. While no casualties were reported, PRCS announced that shrapnel scattered into the building of Al Amal Hospital, causing fear and panic among patients and IDPs.
* According to World Health Organization (WHO), as of 22 December, nine out of Gaza’s 36 hospitals are partially functional, all located in the south. These hospitals are operating at three times their capacity, while facing critical shortages of basic supplies and fuel, while some are hit. According to the MoH in Gaza, occupancy rates are now reaching 206 per cent in inpatient departments and 250 per cent in intensive care units.
* On 21 December, the World Health Organization (WHO) stated that northern Gaza had been left without a functional hospital due to the lack of fuel, staff, and medical supplies. Al Ahli Hospital is still treating patients but not admitting new ones, along with Shifa, Al Awda and Al Sahaba hospitals. These hospitals are not accessible, resupply is currently not possible, and continue to care for existing patients while also sheltering thousands of IDPs.

### Water, Sanitation and Hygiene

* On 20 December, UNICEF [stated](https://www.unicef.org/press-releases/barely-drop-drink-children-gaza-strip-do-not-access-90-cent-their-normal-water-use) that children in Gaza are not able to access 90 per cent of their normal water use. The impact on children is severe, as they are more susceptible to dehydration, diarrhoea, disease, and malnutrition. Concerns of waterborne diseases such as cholera and chronic diarrhoea are particularly heightened given the lack of safe water, especially following the seasonal rains and flooding. Officials have recorded almost 20 times the monthly average of reported cases of diarrhoea among children under the age of 5, 160,000 cases of acute respiratory infection, and increases in other infectious conditions and illnesses, such as scabies, lice, chicken pox, and skin rashes.
* On 20 December, the Director General of WHO echoed a concern for the rises in infectious disease [stating](https://twitter.com/DrTedros/status/1737549701728092481?ref%5Fsrc=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1737549701728092481%7Ctwgr%5E059c6d723d0dfc2cc1bab5ce7e71b89b2620f0dc%7Ctwcon%5Es1%5F&ref%5Furl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.aljazeera.com%2Fnews%2Fliveblog%2F2023%2F12%2F20%2Fisrael-hamas-war-live-israel-kills-around-100-palestinians-in-one-day) that “Gaza is already experiencing soaring rates of infectious disease outbreaks. Diarrhoea cases among children aged under 5 are 25 times what they were before the conflict. Such illnesses can be lethal for malnourished children, more so in the absence of functioning health services.”

### Food security

* The Integrated Food Security Phase Classification (IPC), identifies five Phases of classification for food security: Minimal (1), stressed (2), crisis (3), emergency (4) and catastrophe/Famine (5). The recent estimates from the IPC reveal an unprecedented level of acute food insecurity in the Gaza Strip. Over 90 per cent of the population in the Gaza Strip (about 2.08 million people) was estimated to face high levels of acute food insecurity, classified in IPC Phase 3 or above (Crisis or worse). Among these, over 40 per cent of the population (939,000 people) were in Emergency (IPC Phase 4) and over 15 per cent (378,000 people) were in Catastrophe (IPC Phase 5).
* Furthermore, in the projected period from the latest IPC findings, spanning from 8 December 2023 to 7 February 2024, the entire population of the Gaza Strip (approximately 2.2 million people) is anticipated to experience severe food insecurity, classified as IPC Phase 3 or higher (Crisis or worse). The IPC Famine Review Committee has been activated amid evidence exceeding acute food insecurity Phase 5 threshold. Among these, over half a million people are facing catastrophic conditions—IPC Phase 5 (Catastrophe), characterized by households experiencing an extreme lack of food, starvation, and exhaustion of coping capacities.

### Hostilities and casualties (Israel)

* Over 1,200 Israelis and foreign nationals have been killed in Israel, including 36 children, according to the Israeli authorities, the vast majority on 7 October.
* During the humanitarian pause (24-30 November), 86 Israeli and 24 foreign national hostages were released. The Israeli authorities estimate that about 129 Israelis and foreign nationals remain captive in Gaza. On 22 December, the UN Secretary-General reiterated his call for all remaining hostages to be released immediately and unconditionally.

### Violence and casualties (West Bank)

* Since 7 October, 293 Palestinians, including 76 children, have been killed in the West Bank, including East Jerusalem. Additionally, two Palestinians from the West Bank were killed while carrying out an attack in Israel on 30 November. Of those killed in the West Bank, 283 were killed by Israeli forces, eight by Israeli settlers and another two either by forces or settlers. This toll represents nearly 60 per cent of all Palestinians killed in the West Bank this year. With a total of 493 Palestinians killed in the West Bank, 2023 is the deadliest year for Palestinians in the West Bank since OCHA began recording casualties in 2005.
* Since 7 October, four Israelis, including three members of the Israeli forces, have been killed in attacks by Palestinians in the West Bank, including East Jerusalem. Another four Israelis were killed in an attack by Palestinians from the West Bank in West Jerusalem (one of the four was killed by Israeli forces who misidentified him).
* Seventy-one per cent of the Palestinian fatalities in the West Bank since 7 October have occurred during search-and-arrest and other operations carried out by Israeli forces, including some – mainly in Jenin and Tulkarm governorates – involving exchanges of fire with Palestinians. Half of the fatalities were reported in operations that did not involve armed clashes.
* Since 7 October, Israeli forces have injured 3,801 Palestinians, including at least 575 children; 51 per cent in the context of search-and-arrest and other operations and 41 per cent of them in the context of demonstrations. Another 88 Palestinians have been injured by settlers and 18 other Palestinians injured either by Israeli forces or settlers. Some 33 per cent of those injuries have been caused by live ammunition, compared with 9 per cent in the first nine months of 2023.

### Settler Violence

* Since 7 October, OCHA has recorded 353 Israeli settler attacks against Palestinians, resulting in Palestinian casualties (35 incidents), damage to Palestinian-owned property (272 incidents), or both casualties and damage to property (46 incidents).
* The weekly average of incidents since 7 October stands at 33, compared with 21 incidents per week between 1 January and 6 October 2023\. The number of incidents since 7 October has declined from 80 incidents in the first week (7-14 October) to 21 incidents between 9 and 14 December. One-third of these incidents included firearms, including shootings and threats of shootings. In nearly half of all recorded incidents, Israeli forces were either accompanying or reportedly seen as supporting the attackers.

### Displacement (West Bank)

* Since 7 October, at least 198 Palestinian households comprising 1,208 people, including 586 children, have been displaced amid settler violence and access restrictions. The displaced households are from at least 15 herding/Bedouin communities. More than half of the displacements occurred on 12, 15, and 28 October, affecting seven communities.
* On December 21, Israeli forces demolished seven residential and livelihood structures in the Tell al Khashaba community (Nablus) due to the lack of Israeli-issued building permits in Area C of the West Bank. As a result, three households, comprising 19 people, including 11 children, were displaced.
* This brings the total number of people displaced following the demolition of their homes to 386 Palestinians, including 204 children, due to lack of Israeli-issued building permits in Area C of the West Bank and East Jerusalem, which are almost impossible to obtain. The monthly average of displacement between 7 October and 7 December represents 27 per cent increase compared with the monthly average of displacement in the first nine months of the year.
* A total of 19 homes have been demolished on punitive grounds since 7 October, resulting in the displacement of 95 Palestinians, including 42 children. This figure is higher than the 16 homes punitively demolished in the first nine months of the year, resulting in the displacement of 78 Palestinians. The Human Rights Committee, in its review of the fourth periodic report of Israel, in 2014, concluded that punitive demolitions are a form of collective punishment and as such are illegal under international law.
* Another 451 Palestinians, including 207 children, have been displaced since 7 October following the destruction of 69 residential structures during other operations carried out by Israeli forces across the West Bank; 55 per cent of the displacement was reported in Jenin Refugee Camp, and 39 per cent in Nur Shams and Tulkarm Refugee Camps (both in Tulkarm).

### Funding

* As of 22 December, Member States have disbursed [US$620 million](https://app.powerbi.com/view?r=eyJrIjoiOTkwZjdhMGEtYmZmNi00MjEyLTk1YmYtZTIxZTg2ZDA4MWQ2IiwidCI6IjBmOWUzNWRiLTU0NGYtNGY2MC1iZGNjLTVlYTQxNmU2ZGM3MCIsImMiOjh9) against the [updated Flash Appeal](https://www.ochaopt.org/content/flash-appeal-occupied-palestinian-territory-2023) launched by the UN and its partners to implement its response plan in support of 2.2 million people in the Gaza Strip and 500,000 in the West Bank. This constitutes nearly 50 per cent of the $1.2 billion requested. Private donations are collected through the [Humanitarian Fund](https://crisisrelief.un.org/opt-crisis).

## HUMANITARIAN NEEDS AND RESPONSES: 11-17 December

### Health

UNRWA carried out the following health activities across Gaza between 7 and 9 December:

* Eight out of 22 UNRWA health centres are still operational in the middle and southern areas of Gaza. On 13 December, 8,265 refugees and non-refugees received health services.
* Midwives are providing care for post-natal and high-risk pregnant women at the eight operational health centres. There are an estimated 50,000 pregnant women in Gaza, with more than 180 giving birth every day. A total of 124 post-natal and high-risk pregnancy cases were attended to at health centres.
* UNRWA continued providing health care to IDPs at shelters through 97 medical teams. Each team is composed of one or two doctors and a nurse. Some 591 health workers in health centres and shelters provided support to 12,305 patients.

### Protection

* The situation in Gaza has deteriorated to the extent whereby protection actors are largely unable to operate, due to communication outages, safety and security risks and the lack of access to northern Gaza, and severe constraints on the activities of service providers and frontline actors.
* There are major and mounting protection concerns for vulnerable groups, including children separated from their families, pregnant and lactating women (PLWs), newborns, persons with disabilities (PwDs), and the elderly.
* The following activities were undertaken during past week included:  
   * The Palestine Medical Relief Society distributed 1,616 dignity kits to PwDs and vulnerable women/girls in UNRWA shelters in Khan Younis  
   * The Treatment and Rehabilitation Centre for Victims of Torture provided 25 people with remote psychological first aid support.

### Food security

* Between 7 October to 10 December, UNRWA distributed flour to about 160,000 people north of Gaza. In the south, flour distribution reached about 1,153,020 people, including 75,000 families outside shelters.
* Since the beginning of December, WFP distributed high energy biscuits (HEB) to about 600,000 internally displaced people (IDPs) in designated shelters. WFP has also distributed food parcels or wheat flour to about 110,000 IDPs during the past two week.
* Some 11,385 IDPs residing in host communities received food parcels to support their food needs for 15 days.
* Throughout the reporting week, only two partners—UAWC and Taawon—managed to implement operations in the northern area of Gaza; they distributed food parcels to approximately 46,250 IDPs in public shelters.
* In the southern area, 11 partners have provided ready-to-eat (RTE) food, food parcels, flour, and hot meals to about 2.5 million people over the past week.
* World Central Kitchen (WCK), in partnership with ANERA and MECA, provided hot meals and RTE to a variety of family sizes. WCK plans to provide community kitchen kits, wood pellets or charcoal, and food products for 28,000 meals.
* The Food Security Cluster (FSS) has set a primary objective to meet the daily food needs of 2.2 million people, for a weekly cumulative target of 15.4 million people. In the current reporting week, FSS partners achieved a coverage of only 18 per cent of the cumulative weekly target.

### Nutrition

Nutrition partners provided the following essential nutrition preventive and curative supplies during the reporting period to prevent malnutrition among children and mothers:

* UNICEF delivered Ready to Use Therapeutic Food (RUTF) quantities to its partners, Juzour and UNRWA, to launch the implementation of the simplified approached for the management of wasting, for children under five with severe acute malnutrition (SAM) and moderate acute malnutrition (MAM).
* UNICEF managed to deliver Lipid-based supplements (SQ-LNS) covering the need of 61,600 children (6-24 months) inside shelters for one month; micronutrient supplements for 1,660 pregnant and breastfeeding women; and Vitamin A supplements for 3,370 infants (6-11 months).
* UNRWA distributed HEBs to 320,000 people and 27,184 date bars to people in shelters, as an immediate urgent food response in emergency.

### Water, Sanitation and Hygiene (WASH)

* A total of 20 WASH partners are currently active and operating across the Gaza Strip. Several organizations are trying to reactivate their operations in Rafah (15), Khan Younis (15), Gaza City (10), and northern Gaza (7).
* The constraints on the import of dual-use items inhibits an adequate WASH response. A consignment of piping and generators were not allowed into Gaza during the humanitarian pause. During the pause, few WASH supplies entered Gaza, despite the use of the prioritization list for entry. No new storage tanks, jerry cans, or cleaning kits entered through Rafah crossing. No latrines were built.
* Water quality and access standards remain unachieved. Access is a key challenge. Water networks are fractured, production points are reduced, power for pumping and distribution is restricted, and storage and outlets are minimized. Many communities are isolated across Gaza, particularly north of Wadi Gaza.
* The CMWU and WASH agencies have produced on average 41,068 cubic metres of water, and have distributed around 80,000 litres of fuel, approximately 11,430 litres daily.

### Shelter and Non-Food Items (NFI)

* During the reporting period, despite some progress in delivering and distributing basic NFIs, including bedding, there remains significant shortages of shelter winterization materials, including tents, tarpaulins, and plastic sheeting.
* IDPs are increasingly seeking shelter in large ad hoc sites.
* Shelter Cluster partners distributed the following items inside and outside collective centres in the southern governorates:  
   * 2,300 kitchen kits  
   * 56,800 blankets and 27,450 mattresses  
   * 2,000 mats  
   * 7,300 tarpaulin sheets

### Logistics

* The Logistics Cluster, together with HELP Logistics and JSI, coordinated an assessment of the Gaza public health capacity for warehousing and logistics between November-December 2023, available [here](https://dlca.logcluster.org/2-palestine-logistics-infrastructure).
* The Cluster has handed over and installed a total of 14 Mobile Storage Units (MSUs) that have augmented the offloading capacity in the Rafah handover point and the storage capacity of four UN Agencies and International NGOs.
* In Al Arish, Egypt, the Logistics Cluster augmented the ERC storage capacity with the installation of 10 MSUs with a dedicated set-up for the temperature-controlled cargo through four inflatable cold rooms, in addition to eight prefabs and four ablution units.

### Prevention of Sexual Exploitation and Abuse

* To enhance communication with communities, the PSEA network adopted a new visual identity named 'Sanad,’ which regularly disseminates safeguarding messages through various mediums, including printed brochures, stickers, and radio spots tailored to the emergency context.
* Given communication challenges in Gaza and limited internet access, the network predominantly relies on printed brochures and stickers to reach the population. UNICEF sent 500,000 Sanad brochures to Gaza for distribution, alongside hygiene kits.
* Sanad initiated social media channels to convey safeguarding messages. In the initial two weeks, messages on these platforms reached about 150,000 users, with over 90 per cent from the West Bank. There are further plans to increase the reach of these channels to a broader audience in the weeks ahead.

**Protection against sexual abuse and exploitation (PSEA) remains a cross-cutting priority for all clusters. The SAWA helpline, reachable at 121 and through WhatsApp at +972 59-4040121 (East Jerusalem at 1-800-500-121), operates 24/7\. This toll-free number is widely disseminated across all areas of intervention to report cases of SEA and to facilitate emergency counselling and referrals for affected communities to access life-saving services. The PSEA Network monitors calls daily and will increase the number of counsellors if necessary.**
