* Between the afternoons of 8 and 11 March, according to the Israeli military, two Israeli soldiers were killed in Gaza. As of 11 March, 247 soldiers have been killed and 1,474 soldiers injured in Gaza since the beginning of the ground operation, according to the Israeli military. In addition, over 1,200 Israelis and foreign nationals have been killed in Israel, the vast majority on 7 October. As of 11 March, the Israeli authorities estimate that 134 Israelis and foreign nationals remain captive in Gaza, including fatalities whose bodies are withheld.
* Hostilities in Gaza continue to endanger the lives of humanitarian aid workers. On 8 March, Anera [reported](https://www.anera.org/press/us-ngo-worker-killed-in-israeli-airstrike/) that its logistics coordinator in Gaza was killed, along with 30-50 other people, in an Israeli airstrike on a shelter in Deir al Balah. The coordinates of the shelter had been shared with the Israeli authorities, according to Anera. Demanding an independent investigation, Anera emphasized “the urgent need for accountability and reliable measures to ensure the safety of aid workers.”
* The malnutrition crisis in Gaza is [accelerating](https://x.com/WFP/status/1766826678687318309?s=20) at an unprecedented pace due to the alarming lack of food, water and health services, according to the World Food Programme (WFP). WFP adds that the crisis heightens the risk of long-term health impacts and is disproportionately affecting women and children, with 90 per cent of mothers and children not eating a diverse diet. As of 10 March, MoH in Gaza reported that the death toll as a result of malnutrition and dehydration in northern Gaza has risen to 25, noting that the figure only reflects hospitalized cases. This includes three children who died at Shifa Hospital on 9 March as well as a two-month-old baby and a 20-year-old woman who died at Kamal Adwan hospital on 10 March, according to the MoH in Gaza. Reiterating its call for a ceasefire and the unfettered flow of humanitarian aid and commercial goods into Gaza, Save the Children [warned](https://reliefweb.int/report/occupied-palestinian-territory/alternative-aid-delivery-gaza-children-do-not-have-time-wait-save-children?utm%5Fsource=rw-subscriptions&utm%5Fmedium=email&utm%5Fcampaign=country%5Fupdates%5F180): “Children in Gaza cannot wait to eat. They are already dying from malnutrition and saving their lives is a matter of hours or days – not weeks.”
* On 8 March, UNFPA, OCHA, and the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) carried out a rapid assessment of Al Ahli and As Sahaba hospitals in Gaza city. Al Ahli Hospital is severely damaged, although a reduction in the intensity of hostilities in the area has improved patients’ access, and some IDPs remain on the grounds of the hospital. Only two surgeons are on staff, and the hospital is relying on volunteers. The facility can treat up to 50 patients and currently has 40 patients, but when over one hundred Palestinians were killed on 29 February while waiting for an aid distribution, it had to cope with approximately 200 patients. Despite being overworked and lacking food for themselves, the medical staff are able to perform general surgery and limited neurology and Ear, Nose and Throat (ENT) services. However, they are in urgent need of specialized equipment and, especially, fuel. As Sahaba Hospital, which specializes in maternity care, is also under-staffed and under-fuelled, with extreme shortages of oxygen and anaesthetics. Staff reported preforming C-section cases with local anesthetics. The inter-agency team delivered maternity equipment and medicine to both hospitals, while UNFPA provided reproductive health kits to As Sahaba hospital and conducted a needs assessment to identify critical maternity and reproductive health needs. On 9 March, WHO delivered orthopedic and trauma items for 150 patients and 13,000 litres of fuel to Al Ahli Hospital, and 12,000 litres of fuel to As Sahaba Hospital. On 10 March, WHO Director-General, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, [reiterated](https://twitter.com/DrTedros/status/1766757145612099737): “We need sustained, safe access to health facilities in order to supply them with urgently needed lifesaving healthcare on a regular basis.”

### West Bank Updates

* On 8 March, according to the Israeli military, seven Israeli soldiers were wounded near the Israeli settlement of Homesh by an explosion, allegedly caused by Palestinians. The explosion followed the opening of fire by armed Palestinians at a military post near the settlement. Consequently, Israeli forces launched a manhunt in Nablus city and the surrounding villages.
* Since 7 October, 417 Palestinians have been killed and 4,665 Palestinians have been injured, including 718 children, across the West Bank, including East Jerusalem, and Israel. Since the beginning of the year, a total of 102 Palestinians have been killed in the West Bank and Israel, compared with 78 in the same period in 2023, the majority by Israeli forces.
* Since 7 October, 15 Israelis, including four members of Israeli forces, have been killed and 97 injured in the West Bank, including East Jerusalem, and Israel.
* Since the beginning of 2024, about 560 Palestinians, including 212 children, have been displaced across the West Bank, including East Jerusalem, because of the demolition of their homes (estimated at 116 houses). More than half of them (over 300) were displaced during operations carried out by Israeli forces, 90 per cent of whom were displaced during operations in refugee camps in Tulkarm and Jenin governorates. Only 21 people were displaced in the same context during the equivalent period of 2023\. The remaining displacements included 36 per cent displaced following the demolition of homes due to the lack of Israeli-issued building permits; and eight per cent on punitive grounds.
* On 10 March, Israeli forces deployed heavy forces at entrances leading to the old city of Jerusalem, denying the entry of young Palestinian men through the gates of Al Aqsa Mosque. Israeli forces also reportedly physically assaulted Palestinians, including women and older persons. Since 7 October, and although there was no official announcement to this effect, the Israeli authorities have been imposing heavy restrictions on access to Al Aqsa Mosque compound on Fridays.
* Between 7 October 2023 and 7 March 2024, some 866 Palestinians, including 358 children, have been displaced because of the destruction of their houses during operations carried out by Israeli forces. The vast majority (93 per cent) of displaced people were in the refugee camps of Nur Shams, Tulkarm and Jenin, where Israeli forces also regularly bulldozed roads and caused extensive damage to electricity, water and sewage infrastructure.
* Since 7 October 2023, OCHA has recorded 626 Israeli settler attacks against Palestinians that resulted in Palestinian casualties (56 incidents), damage to Palestinian-owned property (499 incidents), or both casualties and damage to property (71 incidents).
