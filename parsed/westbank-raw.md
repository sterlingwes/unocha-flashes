* On 21 February, OCHA issued a [report](https://www.ochaopt.org/content/over-4000-palestinians-displaced-west-bank-2023) highlighting trends in displacement in the West Bank, including East Jerusalem, in 2023\. About 4,000 Palestinians were displaced from their homes in 2023, of whom 29 per cent (1,153) were displaced when 214 homes were demolished in Area C and East Jerusalem for lacking building permits issued by the Israeli authorities, the highest such figure documented by OCHA since 2009\. Israeli settler violence and shrinking access to grazing land were also a main cause of displacement; at least 1,539 Palestinians (39 per cent of total displacement) were displaced in this context in 2023, the majority in the aftermath of 7 October, with at least 14 Palestinian communities now completely depopulated. Nearly twenty-five per cent of the overall displacement (911) took place as a result of operations carried out by the Israeli army, particularly in refugee camps in the northern West Bank. Some 200 Palestinians (5 per cent) were additionally displaced from Masafer Yatta and H2 areas of Hebron, citing heightened access and movement restrictions and search-and-arrest operations by the Israeli army after 7 October. Finally, 173 people were displaced as a result of the punitive demolition of homes belonging to the families of Palestinians allegedly responsible for attacks against Israelis, accounting for 4 per cent of overall displacement.

* On 21 February, a Palestinian family in Ath Thuri in East Jerusalem was forced to demolish the two upper floors of their three-storey residential building, due to the lack of Israeli-issued permits. The first floor was built before 1967 and did not receive a demolition order. As a result, five families comprising 23 children, including 12 children, were displaced. Since 7 October 2023, 576 people, including 276 children, have been displaced in Area C, and East Jerusalem, after their homes were demolished due to the lack of Israeli-issued building permits, which are almost impossible to obtain.

* Since 7 October 2023, Israeli forces punitively demolished or sealed off 24 Palestinian-owned homes, displacing 117 Palestinians, including 51 children.

* On 21 February, Israeli forces shot and killed a 15-year-old boy by live ammunition in clashes between Palestinian stone throwers and the Israeli army during a raid in Azzun village in Qalqiliya. Medical sources reported that the ambulance was allowed by Israeli forces to evacuate the boy after around 20 minutes of his injury.

* Initial information indicates that on the morning of 22 February, three Palestinian men from Bethlehem perpetrated a shooting attack near Az Za’ayyem checkpoint that controls access to East Jerusalem from the east. As a result, one Israeli settler and two of the three Palestinian men were killed and six Israelis were injured, one of whom is in critical condition. According to Israeli military sources, three Palestinians stopped their vehicle at a junction close to Ma’ale Adumim settlement during a traffic jam and opened fire at Israeli vehicles. Following the incident, Israeli forces closed all checkpoints leading to Jerusalem.

* Since 7 October 2023, a total of 397 Palestinians have been killed, including 101 children, and 4,530 Palestinians have been injured, including 702 children, in conflict-related incidents across the West Bank, including East Jerusalem, and Israel. During the same period, 13 Israelis, including four members of Israeli forces, were killed and 86 injured in conflict-related incidents in the West Bank, including East Jerusalem, and Israel.

* On 20 February, OCHA issued a [report](https://www.ochaopt.org/content/olive-harvest-2023-hindered-access-afflicts-palestinian-farmers-west-bank) analysing the impact of the 2023 olive harvest in the West Bank, which took place between September and November 2023\. This coincided with the 7 October attack in Israel and the military offensive in Gaza, after which restrictions on movement within the West Bank were intensified and incidents of settler violence against Palestinians significantly increased. It is estimated that at least 96,000 dunums of olive-cultivated land across the West Bank remained unharvested in the 2023 season, primarily in areas in the ‘Seam Zone’ area behind the Barrier, and in the vicinity of Israeli settlements, where long-term restrictions on Palestinian access apply. The agricultural gates along the Barrier remained closed, except for the period between 24 and 30 November when a humanitarian pause was implemented in Gaza. The prior ‘coordination system’ required by Palestinians to access their land in, and in the vicinity of settlements, was cancelled for the duration of the harvest. According to the Food Security Sector, the financial cost of olive oil production losses to the Palestinian economy is estimated at US$10 million. During September-November 2023, OCHA documented 113 harvest-related cases where Israeli settlers attacked Palestinians, damaged over 2,000 trees or stole crops and harvesting equipment. Farmers are concerned that the current restrictions may impede essential upcoming agricultural activities such as ploughing, pruning and weeding.

The house belonged to the family of the Palestinian who was shot and killed while carrying out a shooting attack in Kiryat Malachi in Israel on 16 February, killing two Israelis. Since 7 October 2023 and as of 18 February, Israeli forces punitively demolished or sealed off 24 Palestinian-owned homes, displacing 117 Palestinians, including 51 children.

* Since 7 October 2023, 830 Palestinians, including 337 children, have been displaced, following the destruction of 131 homes during operations carried out by Israeli forces across the West Bank. About 95 per cent of the displacement was reported in the refugee camps of Jenin, Nur Shams and Tulkarm.

* In two separate incidents on 20 February, in Asira al Qibliya village in Nablus, Israeli settlers reportedly from Yitzhar settlement threw a sound grenade at an electricity pole, causing electricity outages in the village for half-an-hour, and opened fire at a Palestinian vehicle when the driver tried to avoid a flying checkpoint they had erected along with the guards of the settlement. Settlers from Yitzhar settlement also raided the village on 21 February and threw stones and incendiary materials in the yard of two houses. As a result, a man was hurt in the leg while the yard of one of the houses and two vehicles parked outside the houses sustained damage. Since 7 October 2023 and as of 21 February, OCHA has recorded 577 Israeli settler attacks against Palestinians that resulted in Palestinian casualties (51 incidents), damage to Palestinian-owned property (463 incidents), or both casualties and damage to property (63 incidents).

### Displacement (West Bank)

* Since 7 October and as of 30 December, at least 198 Palestinian households comprising 1,208 people, including 586 children, have been displaced amid settler violence and access restrictions. The displaced households are from at least 15 herding/Bedouin communities. More than half of the displacements occurred on 12, 15, and 28 October, affecting seven communities. They represent 78 per cent of all displacement reported due to settler violence and access restrictions since the beginning of the year (1,539 people, including 756 children).

* Additionally, Since 7 October and as of 30 December, a total of 429 Palestinians, including 220 children, were displaced following the demolition of their homes due to lack of Israeli-issued permits in Area C and East Jerusalem. This represents 37 per cent of all displacement reported due to the lack of building permit since the beginning of the year (1,160 people). The monthly average of displacement in this context between 7 October and 7 December represents a 27 per cent increase compared with the monthly average of displacement in the first nine months of the year.

* A total of 19 homes have been demolished on punitive grounds since 7 October, resulting in the displacement of 95 Palestinians, including 42 children. Between January and September 2023, 16 homes were punitively demolished, resulting in the displacement of 78 Palestinians. Punitive demolitions are a form of collective punishment and as such are illegal under international law.

* Another 483 Palestinians, including 222 children, have been displaced since 7 October following the destruction of 73 residential structures during other operations carried out by Israeli forces across the West Bank; 55 per cent of the displacement was reported in Jenin Refugee Camp, and 39 per cent in Nur Shams and Tulkarm Refugee Camps (both in Tulkarm).

### Violence and casualties (West Bank)

* On 12 December, Israeli forces killed five Palestinian men and injured several others during a large-scale operation that they carried out in Jenin city and Jenin Refugee Camp. The operation included a drone strike that killed four of the five people. A six and a seventh Palestinian, including a 13-year-old child, died after their access to medical care and hospitalization was impeded during the incident. During the operation, Israeli forces surrounded the three main hospitals in the city, and obstructed the movement of ambulances, including those transporting the injured. Additionally, Israeli forces caused extensive damage to infrastructure and private property.

* Since 7 October, 271 Palestinians, including 69 children, have been killed in the West Bank, including East Jerusalem. Additionally, two Palestinians from the West Bank were killed while carrying out an attack in Israel on 30 November.

This toll represents more than half of all Palestinians killed in the West Bank this year. 2023 is the deadliest year for Palestinians in the West Bank since OCHA began recording casualties in 2005\.

* Since 7 October, four Israelis, including three members of Israeli forces, have been killed in attacks by Palestinians in the West Bank, including East Jerusalem. An additional four Israelis were killed in an attack by Palestinians from the West Bank in West Jerusalem (one of the four was killed by Israeli forces who misidentified him).

Israeli forces then removed the family from their agricultural land. In the two remaining incidents, armed Israeli settlers raided the Palestinian communities of Al Farisiya-Khallet Khader and Ein al Hilwa (both in Tubas), physically assaulted residents and took livestock.

* Since 7 October, OCHA has recorded 336 settler attacks against Palestinians, resulting in Palestinian casualties (35 incidents), damage to Palestinian-owned property (256 incidents), or both casualties and damage to property (45 incidents).
