## WEST BANK HUMANITARIAN OVERVIEW

**Casualties**

In the West Bank, including East Jerusalem, confrontations between Palestinians and Israeli forces have continued for the third consecutive day. Between 7 and 11 October, 26 Palestinians, including three children, were killed by Israeli forces in multiple incidents, and 427 Palestinians, including 62 children, were injured. Sixteen (16) out of the 26 Palestinians killed and most of the injuries (368) were reported in clashes during demonstrations in solidarity with residents of the Gaza Strip. Overall, 227 Palestinians were treated for teargas inhalation, 131 were shot with live ammunition, 35 were injured by rubber bullets, nine were hit by shrapnel or teargas canisters, and 25 were physically assaulted.

**Access restrictions**

The Israeli authorities have continued to impose multiple movement restrictions, including the closure of several checkpoints and the blocking of entrances to towns and cities across the West Bank. This has been done either by closing road gates or erecting earth mounds disconnecting cities and towns from the main roads in the West Bank for the fifth consecutive day.

Since 7 October, Israeli authorities continue to isolate six communities severed from the rest of the West Bank by the Barrier (the Barta’a enclave), home to about 9,000 people, by closing the checkpoint and Barrier gates impeding their movement and access to services. All checkpoints segregating part of the Israeli-controlled area of Hebron (H2) from the rest of the city were closed for the fifth consecutive day, impeding the movement of 7,000 Palestinian residents, and preventing them from reaching essential services. Access of Palestinians to the Old City in Jerusalem, including the Al Aqsa Mosque, has been also restricted for the fifth consecutive day.

**Attacks on health care**

WHO has documented 18 health attacks since 7 October in the West Bank, including 15 attacks involving obstruction to delivery of health care; seven involving physical violence towards health teams; five involving detention of health staff and ambulances; and three involving militarized search of health assets.

_**Casualties**_ 

In the West Bank, including East Jerusalem, confrontations between Palestinians and Israeli forces have continued for the third consecutive day in multiple locations. Between 7 and 10 October, as of 16:00, 19 Palestinians, including three children, were killed by Israeli forces in various areas across the West Bank. A total of 332 Palestinians, including 39 children, were injured by Israeli forces in the West Bank, including East Jerusalem. Most of the injuries (307) were reported in various demonstrations in solidarity with residents of the Gaza Strip, during which confrontations were reported between Palestinians who threw stones and, in some instances, opened fire and Israeli forces who shot live ammunition. Overall, 169 Palestinians were treated for teargas inhalation, 104 were shot with live ammunition, 32 were injured by rubber bullets, seven were hit by shrapnel or teargas canisters, and 20 were physically assaulted.

_**Settler-related violence**_ 

Over the past two days, the situation in Palestinian communities near settlements across the West Bank has been reported as very tense. In Einabus (Nablus) dozens of armed settlers reportedly from Yitzhar settlement attacked the village accompanied with Israeli forces. Settlers threw stones causing damage to three homes, set fire to another one and to a Palestinian vehicle, and opened fire at residents who threw stones. During the event, a total of eight Palestinians, including one child were injured, including four Palestinians injured with live ammunition fired by either Israeli forces or settlers. Attacks by settlers with live ammunition against Palestinian vehicles travelling on roads near Al Mu'arrajat Center and East (both in Ramallah) and Jaba’ between Nablus and Jenin, were also reported, causing damage to at least three vehicles. 

In the southern West Bank, in two separate incidents on 8 and 9 October, dozens of armed settlers attacked Palestinian families in Al Ganoub herding community located near Sa’ir (Hebron) and another family in as Samu village (Hebron) and forced them to leave the area at gun point. Settlers also set fire to two residential tents and vandalized nine water tanks, and two solar systems. Subsequently, three families of 15 members, including five children, were displaced. 

_**Access restrictions**_

The Israeli authorities have continued to impose multiple movement restrictions, including the closure of several checkpoints and the blocking of entrances to towns and cities across the West Bank. This has been done either by closing road gates or erecting earth mounds disconnecting cities and towns from the main roads in the West Bank for the third consecutive day. 

Since 7 October, Israeli authorities continue to isolate Barta'a enclave communities, comprising of six communities, home to about 9,000 people, by closing the checkpoint and Barrier gates impeding their movement and access to services. All checkpoints segregating part of the Israeli-controlled area of Hebron (H2) from the rest of the city were closed for the fourth consecutive day, impeding the movement of 7,000 Palestinian residents, and preventing them from reaching essential services. Access of Palestinians to the Old City in Jerusalem, including the Al Aqsa Mosque, has been also restricted for the fourth consecutive day. 

_**Attacks on health care**_

WHO has documented 15 health attacks since 7 October in the West Bank, recorded in the WHO Surveillance System for Attacks on Health Care. Including 13 attacks involving obstruction to delivery of health care; five involving physical violence towards health teams; four involving detention of health staff and ambulances; and three involving militarized search of health assets.

Humanitarian needs across the OPT continue to rise, the response to which is impeded by a current lack of access.
